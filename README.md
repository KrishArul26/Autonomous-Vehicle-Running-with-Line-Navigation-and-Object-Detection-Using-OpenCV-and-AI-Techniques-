<h4 align="left">Introduction
  
<h4 align="left">Mobility on a wide scale is moving towards complete automation. Though the technology for automating the vehicles already exists, these technologies must be optimised to fit the current environment.  This project would be a scaled-down model of the Autonomous Car. By running these scaled-down models in the live streaming line detection using OpenCV..</h4>
