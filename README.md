<h4 align="left">Mobility on a wide scale is moving towards complete automation. Though the technology for automating the vehicles already exists, these technologies must be optimised to fit the current environment.  This project would be a scaled-down model of the Autonomous Car and focus on the live streaming lane detection using OpenCV.</h4>
